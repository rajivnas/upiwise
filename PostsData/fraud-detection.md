## Temporal Pattern Recognition

Key architecture components:

- Bidirectional LSTM layers
- Attention mechanisms for feature importance
- Synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE)

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(30, 10)),  # 30 timesteps, 10 features
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

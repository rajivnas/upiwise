## Neural Network Architectures

Modern fraud detection systems use these key components:

- LSTM networks for sequence analysis
- Random Forests for anomaly detection
- Graph neural networks for pattern recognition

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

clf = IsolationForest(contamination=0.01)
clf.fit(transaction_data)
predictions = clf.predict(new_transactions)

```

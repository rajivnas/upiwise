## The Evolution of Digital Payments

With the rapid adoption of UPI payments in India, security remains a top priority. In 2024, we're seeing three major trends:

1. Biometric authentication integration
2. AI-powered fraud detection systems
3. End-to-end encryption upgrades

### Key Implementation Strategies

- **Two-factor authentication** becomes mandatory for high-value transactions
- New **device binding protocols** to prevent SIM swap attacks
- Real-time **transaction monitoring systems**

```typescript
// Sample security check implementation
interface Transaction {
  amount: number;
  recipient: string;
  location?: string;
}

function validateTransaction(tx: Transaction): boolean {
  return tx.amount < 50000; // Initial threshold
}
```
